-- I want mouse follow focus when:
--  * changing focus
--  * changing tag
--  * swapping clients
--  * add/remove a client (new, minimizing, raising, ...)
-- And I don't want to move the mouse when:
--  * moving/resizing with mouse
--  * raising a client with the mouse (clicking the tasklist)
--  * a client is raising on another tag

-- Some explanations of the code:
-- When moving the mouse, I check that it is not on the wibar (I'm probably using it), and not already
-- on the focused client (it's too anoying), and some other obvious checks.
--
-- I move the mouse on raised signal, because doing so with the focus signal is not compatible with the
-- "focus follow mouse" behaviour.
--
-- When switching tags, there is no raised signal, only focus so I added a step, on tag::history::update
-- screen signal ask for the next client with focus gets the mouse.
--
-- When you swap clients, there are 2 swapped signals sent, one for each client, with the is_source
-- parameter changing.
-- BUT (yes, big "but" !), when the swapped signal is sent, the clients did not actually swap yet,
-- and the focused client position is still the old one. Easy, you just have to send the mouse to the other
-- client then ... and then the "focus follows mouse" comes into action and the other client is now the focused one.
-- To fix that, I added a timer of a few miliseconds when moving the cursor so
-- that when it does, the client was actually moved and there is no "focus follow mouse" problem.
--
-- For add or remove a client, there are a lot of swapped signals sent, you don't actually need to check for the
-- is_source parameter like I initially did.
